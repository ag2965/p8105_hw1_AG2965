================

We will load the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

We will load the tidyverse.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1

## Description of the penguins dataset

### Data in this dataset:

The penguins dataset has 8 variables, including ‘species’, ‘island’,
‘bill_length_mm’, ‘bill_depth_mm’, ‘flipper_length_mm’, ‘body_mass_g’,
‘sex’, and ‘year’. There 3 species of penguins on 3 islands included.

### Size of the dataset:

There are 344 rows and 8 columns in this dataset.

### Mean flipper length:

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047

### Scatterplot

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

We will save the scatterplot as a PDF file.

# Problem 2

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

Create a data frame comprised of:

1)  a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
2)  a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
3)  a character vector of length 10
4)  a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df=tibble(randomsample=rnorm(10),
               logical = randomsample > 0,
               character=c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j" ),
               factor=factor(c("small", "small", "small", "medium", "medium", "medium", "large", "large", "large", "large")))
```

\#Mean of random sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution,
this works The mean -0.0709043

\#Mean of a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
greater than 0, this works The mean 0.5

\#Mean of a character vector of length 10, this doesn’t work The mean NA

\#Mean of a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
The mean NA

\#In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?
